# Emergency Face Visor
 Emergency Face Visor Design for Protection against Droplets in Face-To-Face Situations.

 This might not be the optimal solution, feel free to improve or provide feedback.
This has also not gone through stringent medical evaluation. (Obviously...)

 There is ongoing discussion that the curvature matters (protection from the side, where the air flow comes from...). If anybody has data please let me know.
 At the moment design is driven by material availability. (Shield size is US Letter...)

Right now (in the US) the main target for this design is people that have face-to-face contact (Grocery workers, restaurant-takeout etc.) to protect them or the customers.
As the situation changes it might be nessassary to push designs like these into medical use.

## Design Considerations
- Optimized Cutting Time
- Simple to assemble
- Reusable if possible
- Secure attachment to head to reduce readjusting
- Standard Materials/Tools
- Easily printable on cheap K40 lasercutters
- Includes 6x template that cuts on 9" x 11" bed
- Using mostly available 3mm (Actual 2.72mm) Plywood or acrylic
- CAD Files are designed with FreeCAD
- We tried an even simpler design with attachment points directly on the large part but the shield became too wobbly so we went back to the 4-part solution (Which uses the same amount of material)

## Instructions
- Download the whole repository
- Laser cut the visor_clipon_complete_v2.svg
- Attach the clips to the 3 slots with the hooks in the same direction.
- Punch Letter-sized transparent shield with standard American 3-Hole Punch.
- Attach shield to holder by pushing the holes over the hooks.
- Attach to cap by sliding the holder onto cap

## Notes on Laser-Cutting
- We use 3mm (Actual thickness 2.74mm) Plywood
- Cutting at 36% Power with 10mm/sec on K40
- Make sure to do a test-fit for the clip-on tabs. Depending on material thickness the slots mightr need adjustment !
- If sizes need to be adjusted due to different material thickness the attachment clips are parameterized in Freecad, the slots on the big part are easiest adjusted by creating a copy of the slot in the middle, modifying it and replacing the existing slots in Inkscape.
(Adding the slots to the CAD-Model makes it hard to still control the curvature....)

## Safety Considerations
- This is obviously not approved medical supply. But based on your circumstances it it significantly better then nothing.
- Thought was given to the fact that touching your face is bad. That's why we picked a baseball cap as the base (Besides everybody has one...) because any construction that wraps around your head is prone to slipping and adjusting....
- There is a minimum amount of open space around the attachment holes. Can be fixed with tape if this is seen as a risk.
- The visor sould be reusable if washed/desinfected in soap-water. For the clip it depends on the material. Acryic might be desinfectable, plywood is more tricky and should probably be disposed in the correct way after use.
