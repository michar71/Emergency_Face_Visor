## Design Considerations
- Optimized Cutting Time
- Simple to assemble
- Reusable if possible
- Secure attachment to head to reduce readjusting
- Standard Materials/Tools

## Instructions
- Laser cut the parts, attach the clips to the 3 dslots with the hooks in the same direction.
- Punch Letter-sized transparent shield with standard American 3-Hole Punch.
- Attach Shield to holder by pushing the holes over the hooks.
- Attach to Cap by sliding the holder onto cap

## Safety Considerations
- This is obviously not apparoved medical supply. But based on your cirscumstances it it significantly better then nothing.
- Thought was given to the fact that touching your face is bad. That's why we picked a baseball cap as the base (Besides everybody has one...) because any construction that wraps around your head is prone to slipping and adjusting....
- There is a minimum amount of open space around the attachment holes. Can be fixed with tape if this is seen as a risk.
- The visor sould be reusable if washed/desinfected in soap-water. For the clip it depends on the material. Acryic might be desinfectable, plywood is more tricky and should probably be disaposed in the correct way after use.
